 * {@link SecurityContextHolder} by the authentication mechanism which is being used. An
 * explicit authentication can be achieved, without using one of Spring Security's
 * authentication mechanisms, by creating an <tt>Authentication</tt> instance and using
 * the code:
 *
 * <pre>
 * SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(anAuthentication);
 * </pre>
 *
 * Note that unless the <tt>Authentication</tt> has the <tt>authenticated</tt> property
 * set to <tt>true</tt>, it will still be authenticated by any security interceptor (for
 * method or web invocations) which encounters it.
 * <p>
 * In most cases, the framework transparently takes care of managing the security context
